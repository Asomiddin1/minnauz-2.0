## 4. Fundamental Development Rules

### Rule 1: The Documentation is the Source of Truth
Before adding or modifying any database model, API endpoint, authentication flow, or business logic, consult `docs/`. Never introduce conflicting architecture without documented justification.

### Rule 2: Synchronize Changes Immediately
Whenever you alter database schemas, API contracts, user permissions, or system capabilities, you **must update the relevant `docs/` files immediately** in the same change.

### Rule 3: Do Not Duplicate Systems
Before writing a new service, guard, component, or utility, check the existing codebase and documentation. Re-use and extend existing systems wherever possible.

### Rule 4: Zero Exposure of Secrets
Never commit passwords, API keys, JWT secrets, or production credentials to documentation or git. Use template environment variables documented in `environment.md`.

## 5. Current Project Status

- **API (`api/`)**: Fully functional NestJS backend with Swagger documentation at `/api/docs`, Prisma ORM connection, OTP authentication with Nodemailer, Google Auth endpoint, Course & 5-section Lesson management, Study Plan and Streak tracking, Notification center, Dynamic Banner manager, and Video upload storage.
- **Web App (`web/`)**: Next.js 15 application with multi-language i18n (`/uz`, `/ru`), Student Dashboard (`/dashboard`), Course Roadmap & 5-tab Lesson Studio (`/dashboard/courses`), Notification inbox (`/dashboard/notifications`), Profile & Study Plan manager, and full-featured Admin Panel (`/admin`).
